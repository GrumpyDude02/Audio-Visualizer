# Audio Visualizer

A simple audio visualizer/player made with pygame-ce. Still in developpment

### TODO:

- Implement basic controls
- Show track's name and artist
- Add scrollable list with the ability to remove tracks
- Add some customization
- Find a way to resize the window without pausing (SDL problem)
- Find a way to automatically switch the audio output device for other platforms (automatic output switching currently only works with windows)
