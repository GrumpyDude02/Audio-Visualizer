A simple audio visualizer/player made with pygame-ce.Drag and drop a FLAC/MP3 file into the window, the track should start playing.The project is still in developpment.

### TODO:

- Refactor
- ~~Implement basic controls~~
- Show track's name and artist
- Add scrollable list with the ability to remove tracks
- Add some customization
- ~~Find a way to resize the window without pausing (SDL problem)~~
- ~~Find a way to automatically switch the audio output device for other platforms (automatic output switching currently only works with windows)~~
